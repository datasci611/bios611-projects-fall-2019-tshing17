Urban Ministries of Durham is an organization that connects with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty.  Urban Ministries of Durham has three main programs: the Community Shelter, the Community Cafe, and the Food Pantry and Clothing Closet.

Over the years, Urban Ministries of Durham has collected data on their services provided at the Community Resource Center which consists of both the Community Cafe and the Food Pantry and Clothing Closet.  This includes a record of whether food, clothing, or items were received by an individual who visisted the community center.  The goal of this project is to provide useful practice recommendations for Urban Ministries of Durham based on their records of services provided.

Therefore, this project seeks to answer the following questions:
1. Who is using the Community Resource Center and how often?
* How many people visit the Community Resource Center each year? each month?
* On average, how often do people visit the Community Resource Center each year? each month?
2. What resources are being used and when?
* How much food in pounds is being consumed each year? each month?
* How many clothing items are provided each year? each month?

The date of the services provided (*Date*) will be a key variable in exploring these questions.  Other variables of interest are food in pounds (*Food.Pounds*) and clothing items (*Clothing.Items*).

This project is an exploratory analysis of the services provided by Urban Ministries of Durham.  Yearly, and if possible, monthly frequencies of people who used service will be tabulated.  Similarly, the total number of visits per person per year will be calculated then averaged across all persons for each year.  Yearly, and if possible, monthly averages of food in pounds and clothing items will be tabulated.  Finally, plots over time will be generated from these estimates.
