1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
Yes, the Make script is included, although I haven't tested.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes, both are used.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
Yes.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
Yes. The plots explain the research questions very well. Personally I like the plots by showing the percentage.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
Overall it's perfect, one potential suggestion is that explicitly defining the dataset used in the project (I see you mention this point in the README file and the final output, but considering there are so many datasets, telling audience which datasets are used would be helpful if they try to follow your work).

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
Yes, from the README file I could clearly see the purpose, background information and research questions.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
Yes, if I were the staff from UMD I would find it very helpful.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
Yes, explanations are provided in the README file.

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
Yes, detailed interpretation come with plots.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
Yes, same as #8, explanations are provided in the README file.

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
Yes.

Overall it's a perfect project and I learned a lot from your choice and interpretation of figures.
